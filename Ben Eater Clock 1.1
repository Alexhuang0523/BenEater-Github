                       555 Timer
          Transistor + Comparator + SR Latch   
                       
                        Curcuit

              Wires act as an Inductor(Impedance)
As we run Current through the wire we will get a Magnetic feild that is
going to resist changes to the Current that flows through the wire

                      Ohm's Law 
                          V
                        I   R 
        V = Voltage   I = Current   R = Resistance    

  Orange Line   = LED Output
  Blue Line     = Capacitor Charge/Discharge
                               Total 5 volts divided into 3 Segments 
                    Discharge  volts above/equal 3.33 volts
                    Charge     volts below/equal 1.67 volts

  Capacitor   (1 Micro-Farad 50 Volts)
  Resistor A (1k Ohms)
  Resistor B (100k Ohms)
  Variable Resistor (Change Speed)
    If the LED is flashing TOO FAST, it looks like being TURN ON as normal 
  
          Calculation for Discharge Time 
T = t1 + t2
  = 0.693 (Ra + 2Rb) C
                      \ 
                   Capacitor 
  = 0.693 (1k + 2*100k) 0.000002    
  = 0.278586 milliseconds 
Period of the LED flashing
