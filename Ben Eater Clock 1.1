                       555 Timer
          Transistor + Comparator + SR Latch   
                       
                        Curcuit
        Capacitor + Resistor + 555 Timer + LED
    
               Wires act as an Inductor(Impedance)
As we run Current through the wire we will get a Magnetic feild that is
going to resist changes to the Current that flows through the wire

  Orange Line   = Output & Input 
 (0 to 5 Volts)
  Blue Line     = Capacitor Charge
Capacitor (1 Micro-Farad 50 Volts)
Resistor  (1k Ohms)
Variable Resistor (Change Speed)
  If the LED is flashing TOO FAST, it looks like TURN ON as normal 

    Discharge Time 
T = t1 + t2
  = 0.693 (Ra + 2Rb) C
                      \ 
                   Capacitor 
  = 0.693 (1k + 2*100k) 0.000001   
  = 0.139293 milliseconds 
Period of the LED flashing
