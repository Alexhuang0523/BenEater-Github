                       555 Timer
          Transistor + Comparator + SR Latch   
                       
                        Curcuit
        Capacitor + Resistor + 555 Timer + LED
        
Capacitor (1 Micro-Farad 5 Voltage)
Resistor  (1k Ohms)
Variable Resistor (Change Speed)
    If the LED is flashing TOO FAST, it looks like TURN ON as normal 
    
               Wires act as an Inductor(Impedance)
As we run Current through the wire we will get a Magnetic feild that is
going to resist changes to the Current that flows through the wire
