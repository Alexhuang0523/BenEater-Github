                      Ohm's Law 
                          V
                        I   R 
        V = Voltage   I = Current   R = Resistance    

       Comparison between Ouput(from Chip) and Capacitor 
       
  Orange Line   = LED Output
  Blue Line     = Capacitor Charge/Discharge
                               Total 5 volts divided into 3 Segments 
                  Discharge  volts above/equal 3.33 volts
                  Charge     volts below/equal 1.67 volts
                  Resistor's Ohms smaller Capacitors Charge/Discharge faster 

  Capacitor           (1 Micro-Farad 50 Volts)
  Resistor A          (1k Ohms)
  Resistor B          (100k Ohms)
  Variable Resistor   (Change Speed)
    If the LED is flashing TOO FAST, it looks like being TURN ON as normal 
  
                Calculation for Discharge Time 
  T = t1 + t2
   = 0.693 (Ra + 2Rb) C
                      \ 
                   Capacitor 
   = 0.693 (1k + 2*100k) 0.000002    
   = 0.278586 milliseconds 
                  \
       Period of the LED flashing  
       
1 second LED flashes 1/0.278586 milliseconds = 3.6 times 

                        Power Supply 
                            Noise 
Output TURN ON   0 volt to 5 volts (lots of junk up down up down)  
Solution : Put Capacitor at Chip Pin 5     

                           Impedance 
                    Wire acts as an Inductor 
As we run Current through the wire we will get a Magnetic feild that is
going to resist changes to the Current that flows through the wire

Output TURN ON   0 volt to 5 volts (within Transistors)
                 supply more than 5 volts to LED (Overshooting)
Solution : Put Capacitor to smooth Current Transactions
