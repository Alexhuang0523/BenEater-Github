       Comparison between Ouput(from Chip) and Capacitor   
 Orange Line   = LED Output
 Blue Line     = Capacitor Charge/Discharge
                               Total 5 volts divide into 3 Segments 
                  Discharge  volts above/equal 3.33 volts
                  Charge     volts below/equal 1.67 volts
                  Resistor's Ohms smaller Capacitors Charge/Discharge faster

                        Power Supply 
#    1                     Noise 
Output TURN ON   0 volt to 5 volts (lots of junk up down up down)  
Solution : Put 0.01 mirco Capacitor at Chip Pin 5     

#    2                   Impedance 
                   Wire acts as an Inductor 
As we run Current through the wire we will get a Magnetic feild that is
going to resist changes to the Current that flows through the wire

Output TURN ON   0 volt to 5 volts (within Transistors)
                 supply more than 5 volts to LED (Overshooting)
Solution : Put 0.1 micro Capacitor near Power supply to smooth 
           Current Transactions

#    3                     Speed
                        LED flashing 
Solution : Tie a Variable Resistor to Resistor A & Resistor B  
As the LED is flashing TOO FAST, it looks like being TURN ON as normal
