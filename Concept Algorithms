Search Algorithms
Rage 1 - 100, Answer is 5

1,2,3,4,5  
Linear Search takes 5 tries to get answers 
60,50,25,15,4,6,5 
Binary Search takes 7 tries to get answers

Rage 1 - 10, Answer is 10

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10  
Linear Search takes 10 tries to get answers
B : 5,8,9,10
take 4 tries to get answers

Conclusion :
There is no best way to get answers, It depends on the situations
Tries = Seconds


- Clear Problem Statement
- Input
- Output (produce a result)
- Specific Order 
- Complete in a Finite Time
