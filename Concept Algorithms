Rage 1 - 100, Answer is 5

1--2--3--4--5  
Linear Search takes 5 tries to get answers 
60--50--25--15--4--6--5 
Binary Search takes 7 tries to get answers

Rage 1 - 10, Answer is 10

1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9--10  
Linear Search takes 10 tries to get answers
5--8--9--10
Binary Search takes 4 tries to get answers

Conclusion :
There is no best way to get answers, It depends on the context 
Tries = Seconds
n = size of the context 


- Clear Problem Statement
- Input
- Output (produce a result)
- Specific Order 
- Complete in a Finite Time
