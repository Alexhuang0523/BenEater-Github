                                              RAM                   
Static RAM (Register/Latch)
  Data stores for forever unless switch is off 
Dynamic RAM (RAM)
  Data stores for a short time(Capacitor/Charge and Discharge + Resistor) 
  keep Refreshing Writing and Reading

                              RAM + Inverter(LED) + Tri-State Buffer(LED)
Some Output are inverted (Unique design) for example RAM
therefore we need Inverter to re-invert the Output 

                              Address Decode Logic (Dip Swithes)                  
It represents which Row/Byte is used 
              
Address 0 0 0 0  activates ROW 0
Address 1 0 0 0  activates ROW 1

#  1
