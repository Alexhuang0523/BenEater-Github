HEAP  
   Memory area of JVM
JIT & AOT 
 | Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language

 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal

                  Lexical Analysis 
                      - Done by lexer (Scanner)
                      - Identifies lexemes 
                      - Generates stream of tokens (Regular representation)
                      - Creates symbol & string table

                   Syntax Analysis
                      - Done by parser 
                  Semantic Analysis
                      - Context-free grammar Backus-Naur form (written by programmer)
                      - Identifies Syntax errors 
                           - Operators, Identifiers 
                      - Concrete/Abstract Syntax tree

 How Compiler works depends on Processor Architecture
