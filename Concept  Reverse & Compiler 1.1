Compiler is just a Programme with Computer Model and Algorithm

HEAP  
   Memory area of JVM
JIT & AOT 
 | Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language
 |
 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal
