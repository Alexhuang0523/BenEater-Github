VASM
Machine/Assembly language <===> Binary language 

Processor + EEPROM + RAM + AND gate +
LCD interface + Capacitor + Oscillator 

# 1
RAM 
Install RAM for "Stack" function (Assembly language)
for better coding 
# 2
Capacitor 
It is used to control the Stability of "Voltage" & "Current Flow"
# 3
Oscillator 
It is related to "Megahertz" ~ Speed 
Busy flag 

  Bus Timing (Transfer Bus)
Processor <===> ROM <===> RAM
       ROM High A15
      RAM Low A0-A14
Timing for Processor to read or write Data (Input & Output)

LOOP
Bus flag = send instruciton to LCD when not busy(Megahurtz)
