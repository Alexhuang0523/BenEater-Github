                   Controlling how long the light stay  

As Inverter Q turn off Current will not go through Transistor
within "555 Timer" anymore (No Charge/Discharge) 
                        
Current will go through 1K Transistor and Capacitor to Ground 

Capacitor starts to charge to above 3.33 volts
                    
Comparator is triggered(Reset) Output becomes (0)
