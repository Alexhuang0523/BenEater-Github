   We only use 0000-3FFF for stack 

Tie A15(0) to CS Chip Select 
Tie A14(0) to OE Output Enable

We ensure A15 "Chip Select" is "Low" when "Clock pulse" is "High" by
using two Invert AND Gates(NAND) 
By the way we also need to consider whether the two logic gates
we just add will have any effect on the Timing 

A15(0) ===> Invert AND Gate (1) ===\ 
                                    ====> Invert AND Gate(0) ===> Chip Select(0)
          Clock Signal(1) =========/             
          
The Bus wil read "garbage" which means no data in some moment
