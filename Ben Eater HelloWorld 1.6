We ensure A15 "Chip Select" is "Low" when "Clock Pulse" is "High" by
using two NAND Gates
By the way we also need to consider whether the two logic gates
we just add will have any effect on the Timing

The Bus wil read "Garbage" which means no data in some moment

# 1                   Current Stability 
Changing Current Flow will affect Magnetic Field 
Changing Magnetic Field around wire will induce voltage in wire
