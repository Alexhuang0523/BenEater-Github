Processing :
Users make a project in thier Desktop or Laptop maybe for a week or  a month, 
suddenly they want to turn this project or this folder to a Git Repository and push it to GitHub 

Example :
cd
  Find the folder directory(folder location) in CMD
git status 
  Use "git status" commend to whether there is a Git Repository 
git init 
  If the folder is not a Git Repository, use "git init" commend to initialize a empty Git Repository
  After "git init" commend use "git status" commend to check the folder status again
  In CMD it will mention "dance.txt", file which users have amended on thier Desktop 
git add dance.txt
  Here comes a terms called staging, when users only want to commit certain files not all files 
  "git add" commend will be applied, for example if users have changed 5 files on thier Desktop
  but they just want to commit 3 files instead of all the files, in this situation "git add" is used  
  a sentence of "nothing added to commit untracked files present" may appear in CMD
  "git add" will add the files users want to commit to the "staging area" and commit those files 
  Finally, a "Git Repository" is made
git commit -m "adding a new dance"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Alexhuang0523/My-Blog.git
  Now here we need to create a "Remote" means Repository on GitHub Web Server 
  as Desktop have no idea where to push, the reason why we need to create a new Repository is 
  because now we are creating files in our Desktop not on GitHub 
  so there is no Remote attached 
 git remote 
  Users can use "git remote" commend to to check the Remote name, in here remote's name called 
  "origin" as we have named it as origin 
 git remote -v
  Users can also use "git remote -v" commend to to check the Remote URL 
 git push origin master 
 git pull origin master 
  After we push the file to GitHub and make some commit now we pull it back to our Desktop again 
  with commend "git pull origin master"
  **Pay attention if users are doing the push pull action in the same stage CMD will not require 
  user to key in username and userpassword, what if users restart the Desktop and do it again 
  users need to key in username and userpassword again**
