                    D Flip-flop
Common way of storing Data in Digital Logic Circuit 

Flip-flop means Output only change when there is a Pulse 
0 ===> 1 ===> 0

Enable Input \
Clock Signal - ====> Output 
D Input      /

How to build an Edge Detector Circuit for capturing Clock Signal 
# 1 
5 Volts ===> Push Button Switch ===> Capacitor ===> 2 Resistors ===> Ground  
Capacitor + Resistor makes the output change from 1 to 0 immediately as :
  Capacitor absorbs electrons 
  Resistor resists electric current 

# 2 
Inverter + AND Gate 
Input ===> AND Gate   >   Input ===> Inverter ===> AND Gate 
When these two Input change from 0 to 1
The different speed of these two Inputs make a Pulse, Clock Signal 
0 ===> 1 ===> 0
