API stands for application programming interface, it is type of software interface 

Concept of API :
"API" sames like "Electricity" in our home 
We just plug our "Adapter" into the "Socket" to use the "Electricity", but we have no idea where it comes from 
and how it comes 

Three catergories : Open API(public), Internal API(Private), Partner API(fees required for use)
Three types : Local API, Web Service API & Program API

Web Service API consists of REST, SOAP, JSON-RPC & XML-RPC 

For Exmaple :
If i wish to add GoogleMap and Fringerprint function(two functions) into my APP, it doesn't require me to code these function by myself at all(less duplicate job)
just copy the API URL made into my APP and run it, done !!!!
