                      Parsing (Top-Down Parsing)
Context free Grammar 
-Set of Terminals T
-Set of Non-Terminals N
-Start Symbol 
-Set of Productions 

           Algorithms for Parsing (Recursive Descent Parsing)
-from LEFT to RIGHT 
-from TOP to BOTTOM

 
                Limitation for Recursive Descent Parsing 
-No backtracking to try different productions once we have found a production that succeeds for non-terminal 
-Infinite Loop(Left Recursion) when S=Non terminal 
-Infinite Loop(Left Recursion) can be eliminated by hand,thus this limitation is not major
