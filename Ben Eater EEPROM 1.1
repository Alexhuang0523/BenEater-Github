EEPROM
Addressline ===> Switch ===> Resistor ===> Ground 
Dataline ===> LED ===> Resistor ===> Ground

Chip Enable ===> Ground/Low ~ Enabled  
Write Enable (Programming) ===> RC Circuit  
*AC Write Waveforms* 100 ~ 1000 5 Volts ===> Switch Button ===> Capacitor 
                                ===> Resistor ===> Ground 
                                Capacitor and Resistor used to control Timing 
                            
Output Enable ===> Low/Ground, Datalines become Output 
                   High/5 Volts, Datalines become Input
