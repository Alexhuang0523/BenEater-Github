Register 
Inverter + 2 AND Gates + 1 OR Gate + D Latch  

Tri-state logic (2 Transistors) for Bus Transfer 
1, 0, Disable 
Load (Invert logic line) + Register (always Output) ===> Tri-state buffer + Enable line (Invert logic line)
Low (Register load data from Bus)                                           High (Disconnect) Low (Output)

Bus Transfer 
It allows Modules to communicate with each other 
Modules can put data on the bus and read data from the bus 
Modules consist of Register, Memory, Output etc
