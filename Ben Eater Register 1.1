                          Inverter + 2 AND Gates + 1 OR Gate + D Latch  

Tri-state logic (2 Transistors) for Bus Transfer 
1, 0, Disable 
4Bit D-Type Register (Different Circuit) 
Load (Invert logic line) + Register (always Output) ===> Tri-state buffer + Enable line (Invert logic line)
Low (Register load data from Bus)                                           High (Disconnect/no Output) 
High (Turn off load/Store Data in Register)                                 Low (Output Data to Bus from Register)

                                          Bus Transfer
                                          
It allows Modules to communicate with each other 
Modules can put data on the bus and read data from the bus 
Modules consist of Register, Memory, Output etc 

So far we have :
Register A (4 bits)
Register B (4 bits)
Instruction Register (4 bits) ===> Bus 
                     (4 bits) ===> Instruction decoder

Building ALU 
Register A ===> Adder ====================\ 
Adder A Carry Out <===> Adder B Carry In ===> Tri-state Buffer 
Register B ===> XOR Gates ===> Adder =====/ 


Data keep Adding or Subtracting due to "Clock Signal"  
Data send out from Register A and return back to Register A (Recycle)
