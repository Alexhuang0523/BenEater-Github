Bus Transfer 
It allows "Modules" to communicate with each other 
"Modules"can put data on the bus and read data from the bus 
Modules :
Register 
Memory 
Output 

Tri-state logic 
1, 0, Disable (avoid Input data & Output data conflicts on Bus Transfer) 
Enable (High) = Output data 
Load (High) = Read data 

Current direction in Transistor 
Source 1 = 5 Volt ===> Transistor ===> Output 
Sink 0   = Output ===> Transistor ===> Ground
