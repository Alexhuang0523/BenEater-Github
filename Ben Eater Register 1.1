Register 
Instruction Register 

Bus Transfer 
It allows "Modules" to communicate with each other 
"Modules"can put data on the bus and read data from the bus 
Modules :
Register 
Memory 
Output 

Tri-state logic 
1, 0, Disable (avoid Input data & Output data conflicts on Bus Transfer) 
Load (High) Enable (High) = Store data in register 
Load (High) Enable (Low)  = Put data to bus 
Load (Low) Enable (High)  = Read data from bus 

Inside the chips : 
Current direction in Transistor 
Source 1 = 5 Volt ===> Transistor ===> Output 
Sink 0   = Output ===> Transistor ===> Ground
