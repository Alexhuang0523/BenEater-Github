Git, Install Git software on Desktop 

Basic Commend
cd , change directory 

Write a "git commit" on Git Repository under Terminal(MAC) means CMD(Windows, download GitBash)
Clone = Acting of taking a Repository from GitHub Web Server and download to Desktop 
Desktop can push =====> back to GitHub 
Desktop can pull <===== from GitHub 

Example :
git clone http://github.com/Alexhuang0523/My-Blog.git (URL copy from GitHub)   
  After key in "git clone" CMD will do the cloning . . .
  Now the Repository already in your Desktop folder, open it with "Notepad" "Sublime text" or other text editor, make some changes 
git status 
  Using commend "git status" to view the status of the Repository, users will see a word "modified" 
  In this stage your Repository not yet commit 
  Users must make sure the "file directory" when use commend "git status" 
git commit -a -m "Adding the key of C"   
  -a means all
  -m means leave a comment 
  One more step 
  After users make a commit, all they need to do is to tell Desktop "who you are", what GitHub account they are logging in  
git config --global user.name "Alexhuang0523"
git config --global user.email huangyongjie95@gmail.com
  After users tell the Desktop who they are, use one commend "git config --list" to check whether the information given is correct 
git config --list
  User can also use one commend "git log" to check all commits have made through Desktop CMD 
git log
  **Some text editor VIM, will require user to write ":Q" to exit the git log**
  Everything is done now, next step is to push the Repository back to GitHub we use "git push" 
git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com' : Alexhuang0523
Password for 'https://Alexhuang0523@github.com' : ****
  Now the problems is Desktop has no idea where should it push, here comes a new terms "Remote"
  "Remote" means Web Server GitHub, it can be many "Remote", now we assume only one "Remote"
git remote -v
  Use commend 'git remote" to check your remote name 
  After users get their remote name "origin" they need to put the name after "git push"
  Don't forget the Branches name "Master" as well 
  Final step
  after mentions the Remote and Branch name, user needs to key thier username and password for Desktop to identify your account 
  **Pay attention to which GitHub account(username and eamil) users are logging in**
  
 Conclusion :
 Create a new Repository on GitHub, clone it to Desktop make changes to it and push it back to GitHub
