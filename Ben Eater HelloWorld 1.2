ROM (EEPROM AT28C256) 
Program with some different "Instructions" using different "Addresses" 
instead of using Resistors 

Processor x16 Addressline 
EEPROM    x15 Addressline
NAND Gate
Adapter (Latch)

When the Processor reads all Addressline A0-A15, it will see the contents 
of the EEPROM as repeated twice 


Connect "Processor A15 line" High to the "Chip Enable Signal of EEPROM" with
"NAND Gate" 
A15 Line Low : EEPROM will output Data(D0-D7) as Processor read A0-A14 
A15 Line High : EEPROM will not output any Data(D0-D7) as Processor read A15  

Now Processor is reading low A0-A14 Addressline 
Adjust the starting location of Processor becomes ea ===> 8,000 (Dataline)
rom[0x7ffc] = 0x00
rom[0x7ffd] = 0x80
Example : 
ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea 00 80 ea ea
