ROM (EEPROM AT28C256) 
Program with some different "Instructions" using different "Addresses" 
instead of using Resistors 

Processor x16 Addressline 
EEPROM    x15 Addressline
NAND Gate
Adapter (Latch)

When the Processor reads all Addressline A0-A15, it will see the contents 
of the EEPROM as repeated twice A0-A14, A15

Connect "Processor A15 line" High to the "Chip Enable Signal of EEPROM" with
"NAND Gate" 
A15 Line Low : EEPROM will output Data(D0-D7) as Processor read A0-A14 
A15 Line High : EEPROM will not output any Data(D0-D7) as Processor read A15  

#1   Programming EEPROM : 
Now Processor is reading low A0-A14 Addressline 
Adjust the starting location of executing instruction becomes ea ===> 8,000 (Dataline)
read by Processor 
rom[0x7ffc] = 0x00
rom[0x7ffd] = 0x80
Example : 
ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea ea 00 80 ea ea 

*Operation, Operation Codes and Status Register*
a9 = load particular immediate value to Register A 
8d = store particular immediate value at particular address 
4c = jumping 
if we want to load 42 value to Register A code as below :
rom[0] = 0xa9
rom[1] = 0x42
if we want to store particular immediate value at particular address code as below :
rom[2] = 0x8d
rom[3] = 0x00
rom[4] = 0x60

6000 W 42
Now Processor is putting 42 value to the Transfer Bus not done by "EPPROM"
we can latch value of 42 into a Register or any Hardware  

#2    Adapter 
In order to capture "Address 6000 W 42" outputted by Processor 
Connect Processor to Adapter(Latch) CS1 CS2 with two NAND Gates    
0 1 1

*Memory Map of Internal Register* for Adapter (Latch)
6000 = Output Register 
6002 = Data Direction Register B
*ORB, IRB Operation for Register*
ff (1111 1111) = Set as output 
Steps :
Setting anything stored in Register port B to be output of LED light code as below :
0xa9 0xff
0x8d 0x02 0x60
Outputting anything from Register B code as below :
0xa9 0x55
0x8d 0x00 0x60

0xa9 0xaa
0x8d 0x00 0x60
Jumping to Address 8000 code as below : 
0x4c 0x00 0x80
