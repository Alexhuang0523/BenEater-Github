Processor + EEPROM + RAM + AND gate + LCD interface + Capacitor + Oscillator 

# 1
RAM 
Install RAM for "Stack" function (Assembly language) 
# 2
Capacitor 
It is used to control the Stability of "Voltage" & "Current Flow"
# 3
Oscillator 
It is used to control Speed "Megahertz" related to Busy flag

  Bus Timing (Transfer Bus)
Processor <===> ROM <===> RAM
       ROM High A15
      RAM Low A0-A14
Timing for Processor to read or write Data (Input & Output)

LOOP
Bus flag = send instruciton to LCD when not busy(Megahurtz)
