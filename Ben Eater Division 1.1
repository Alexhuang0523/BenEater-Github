        CPU can only execute "Add" "Substract"              
              How CPU executes Division 
               
Shift Left + Substract with Carry Bit + Conditional (Carry Flag)

Carry bit  Mod10   Mod10+1    Value    Value+1
    0      0000000000000000   0000000000000000
    
           32 bits/4 bytes store under RAM 
           
               For Example : 1729 / 10 
    1      0000000000001101   0000011011000001 (Keep shifting to left)
                      -1010
    1      0000000000000011 (Carry bit doesn't get borrowed) 
                            (Carry bit ---> find a position that can be divided) 
                            (Carry bit will pop up behind the first place of left position)
                            
Once Carry bit becomes positive = 1  We save the result from down to up 
    
    
 Division  1792/10 = 1792 - (10*179) + (2/10)
 
 
                  Set Carry Bit 
                        |
                    Substract 
                        |
                   Rotate Left
                16 bits to 16 bits 
                        |
              If Dividend > Divisor 
        Mod10    2bytes ----> Register Y
        Mod10+1  2bytes ----> Register A 
        Register Y + Register A = Result
                        |
              If Dividend < Divisor 
       Ignore the results, Carry flag = 0
                        |
    Store 16(Times for Rotation) to Register X
                        |
                 Clear Remainder
