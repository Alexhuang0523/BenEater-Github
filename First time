Today is my first day and also my first try to write a blog in GitHub, 
the reason i choose GitHub as now i am trying to learn programming language(JAVA & PYTHON) 

As i know, GitHub is a popular programming-sharing platform, it is well-equipped 
although i have zero knowledge on how to use this useful platform but i still decide to choose it as my study tools 

I will record anything learn from website, from my exprience and my mistakes, Thanks
