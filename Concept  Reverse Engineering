                   |    Native code 
                   |          |    Machine Code         
                   |          |
               Run in JVM    CPU

HEAP  
   Memory area of JVM
JIT & AOT 
 | Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language
 |
 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal

Language-dependent Stages ----> Machine-dependent Stages 
      (Syntax rules)             (Register Allocation)
                       
            Lexical Analysis/Scanner --------> Check any invalid tokens(Lexical Errors,Syntax Errors) 
                 (Tokens class) 
      (Integer/Regular Representation) ----> describing a set of Character Strings
