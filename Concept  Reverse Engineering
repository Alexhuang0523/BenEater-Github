                   |    Native code 
                   |          |    Machine Code         
                   |          |
               Run in JVM    CPU

HEAP  
   Memory area of JVM
JIT & AOT 
 | Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language
 |
 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal

Language-dependent Stages ----> Machine-dependent Stages 
      (Syntax rules)             (Register Allocation)
                       
                  Lexical Analysis 
                      - done by lexer (Scanner)
                      - identifies lexemes 
                      - generates stream of tokens (Regular representation)
                      - creates symbol & string table

               Parsing/Syntax Analysis
                      - Context-free grammar Backus-Naur form (written by programmer)
                      - identifies Syntax errors
