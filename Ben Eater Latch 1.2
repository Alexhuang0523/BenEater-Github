D Flip-flop
Common way of storing Data in Digital Logic Circuit 

Flip-flop means Output only change when there is a Pulse 
0 ===> 1 ===> 0

Element :
Clock 
D Input 
EN Input 
Output 

How to build an Edge Detector Circuit for Clock Signal 
# 1 Method 
5 Volts ===> Switch button ===> Capasitor ===> 2 Resistors ===> Ground  
Capasitor + Resistor makes the output change from 1 to 0 immediately  
Capasitor absorbs electrons 
Resistor resists electric current 

# 2 Method
Inverter + AND Gate 
Input ===> AND Gate   >   Input ===> Inverter ===> AND Gate 
When these two Input change from 0 to 1
The different speed of these two Inputs make a Pulse, Clock Signal 
0 ===> 1 ===> 0
