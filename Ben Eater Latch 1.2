D Flip-flop
Common way of storing Data in Digital Logic Circuit 

Flip-flop means Output only change when there is a Pulse 

Element :
Clock 
D Input 
EN Input 
Output 

How to build an Edge Detector Circuit for Clock Signal 
Add "Capasitor" & "Resistor" before Enable Input  

Speed of Input ===> AND Gate "faster than" Speed of Input ===> Inverter ===> AND Gate 
Difference of speed makes a pulse which is Clock Signal
