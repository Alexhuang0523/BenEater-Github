Compiler is just a Programme with Computer Model and Algorithm

JAVA Source Code 
                ByteCode 
                   |    Native code 
                   |          |    Machine Code

HEAP  
   Memory area of JVM
JIT & AOT 
 | Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language
 |
 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal                   
        
          
                  Teletype Machine 
                  Teletype Protocol 

                      Terminal 
                    Application 
                         |
               Bash ~ Shell (Language) 
                         |
                       Kernel 

Input/Output Subsystem 
Mouse, Monitor, Keyboard, Internet Radio 

All these includes programming language written by Human 
such as JAVA, C++, C 
They are compiled by compiler and stored in Memory
