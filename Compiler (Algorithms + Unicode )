                Reverse Engineering 
                **Compiler Design** 

Compiler is just a Programme with Computer Model and Algorithm

JAVA Source Code 
                ByteCode
            Intermedia code ----> Human & Computer can't read 
                   |              only Virtual Machine can read     
                   |    Native code 
                   |          |    Machine Code         
                   |          |    (Object file)  
               Run in JVM    CPU   (Binary)
                                              Linker 
                                                |
                                              Library
                                              Runtime
                                                    Executable file 
                                                    
HEAP  
    Memory area of JVM
Just-In-Time & AOT 
 |  Place where transfer High-level language to Low-level language 
 |  No need to retranslate for the same code 
 |
 Inlining 
    Same Target Type (Run target code directly)
    Not Same Target Type (Run target method as a call)
 Optimization 
    Doing least amount of work to accomplish goal                   
        
          
                  Teletype Machine 
                  Teletype Protocol 

                      Terminal 
                    Application 
                         |
               Bash ~ Shell (Language) 
                         |
                       Kernel (BIOS) 
 
 
 Command 
    Collection of several instructions in a specific order 
 Instruction
    Single line code that performs an operation 
 
 Command ----> @ = Withdraw 
               # = Load
 
 
Input/Output Subsystem 
Mouse, Monitor, Keyboard, Internet Radio 

All these includes programming language written by Human 
such as JAVA, C++, C 
They are compiled by compiler and stored in Memory
